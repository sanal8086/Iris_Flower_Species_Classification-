# Iris_Flower_Species_Classification-

## Introduction
The Iris dataset is a classic machine learning dataset that contains data on 150 Iris flowers. The dataset has four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. The target variable is the Iris species, which can be one of three values: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, or Iris virginica.

- In this project, we will use all classification algorithms to classify the Iris dataset. We will also include pictures of the different Iris species so that you can visualize the data.

## Data preparation
- The first step is to prepare the data. This involves cleaning the data, removing any unnecessary features, and scaling the features.

##Feature engineering
- We do not need to do any feature engineering for the Iris dataset, as the features are already in a format that is suitable for machine learning algorithms.

## Model training
- We will train a variety of classification algorithms on the Iris dataset, including:

- Logistic regression
- Support vector machines
- Decision trees
- Random forests
- Naive Bayes
- K-nearest neighbors
  
## Model evaluation
- We will evaluate the performance of each model on a held-out test set. This will give us an idea of how well the model will generalize to new data.

## Model deployment
Once we are satisfied with the performance of the model, we can deploy it to production. This means making the model available to users so that they can use it to classify new Iris flowers.
